# Security Plus
Security Plus is a plugin that allows players of your FiveM ESX server to become security guards and protect pre-defined regions or locations throughout San Andreas. A configuration file allows you to add/remove locations to be secured. Also in the configuration file, you can edit things like the HQ position, patrol vehicle, and even different styles for text in the script!

## Still Under Development
This is still a very early release into the plugin; however, I am releasing for public critism and suggestions. Please note that major updates will be posted immediately to the Github. At this time, support will be provided.
