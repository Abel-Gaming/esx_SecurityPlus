# Security Plus
Security Plus is a plugin that allows players of your FiveM ESX server to become security guards and protect pre-defined regions or locations throughout San Andreas. A configuration file allows you to add/remove locations to be secured. Also in the configuration file, you can edit things like the HQ position, patrol vehicle, and even different styles for text in the script!

## Still Under Development
This is still a very early release into the plugin; however, I am releasing for public critism and suggestions. Please note that major updates will be posted immediately to the Github. At this time, support will be provided. This is currently only posted to Github, this has not been published elsewhere.

## Commands
â€¢ /+forceduty - This will allow the player to go on duty without going to HQ
<br>
## Plans
- [x] Timed security patrols (in seconds)
- [x] Paid security contracts (get paid after the time expires)
- [ ] Interaction options for both players and NPC
